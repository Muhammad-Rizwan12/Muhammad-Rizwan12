## Work Experience
**Machine Learning Intern @ ITSOLERA PVT LTD (_June 2024 - Present_)**
- As an Artificial Intelligence Intern specializing in Machine Learning at ITSOLERA PVT LTD, I work with the AI team to create, develop, and apply machine learning algorithms and models. In addition to conducting research on cutting edge machine learning approaches, I help with data collecting, preparation, and analysis. My responsibilities include integrating AI solutions into current systems, installing and scaling up models for performance and scalability, and presenting findings to stakeholders. I use a variety of ML frameworks and Python to keep up with the most recent developments in the industry and to constantly improve my skills.

**Python Intern @ Techno Spot (_July 2023 - October 2023_)**
- During my internship at Company Name, I gained hands-on experience with Python programming and contributed to several projects. My primary responsibilities included:
     Script Development: Wrote and maintained Python scripts to automate routine tasks, helping improve team efficiency.
     Basic Data Handling: Worked with data files to perform simple data cleaning and basic analysis using Python libraries like Pandas.
- This internship provided a solid foundation in Python development and practical experience in using Python to solve real-world problems.
## Projects
### HikeSmart Toxic Plant Detection And Alert:
- A mobile application developed using Flutter, leveraging AI deep learning with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect poisonous and non-poisonous plants in real-time. The CNN model, trained and optimized using TensorFlow, is converted to a TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) model for seamless integration with the app. The project enhances outdoor safety by providing instant plant identification and will soon include a first-aid guidance module for immediate medical recommendations.
### Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning:
- In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict heart disease based on various health metrics. The goal was to create a reliable and efficient system that could assist in early diagnosis and intervention. Key aspects of the project included:
    Data Collection and Preprocessing: Utilized a public dataset containing medical records of patients, which was cleaned and preprocessed to ensure quality input for the model.
    Model Development: Explored and implemented various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. Evaluated each model's performance to identify the most accurate predictor.
    Feature Selection and Engineering: Applied techniques to select the most relevant features and engineered new ones to improve model performance.
    Evaluation and Optimization: Used metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the models. Optimized the best-performing model through hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.
    Deployment and Visualization: Developed visualizations to illustrate the model's predictions and insights. Created a simple interface to allow users to input their data and receive predictions on their heart disease risk.
- This project enhanced my skills in machine learning and provided a practical application of data science in healthcare.
