## Work Experience
**Machine Learning Intern @ ITSOLERA PVT LTD (_June 2024 - Present_)**
- As an Artificial Intelligence Intern specializing in Machine Learning at ITSOLERA PVT LTD, I work with the AI team to create, develop, and apply machine learning algorithms and models. In addition to conducting research on cutting edge machine learning approaches, I help with data collecting, preparation, and analysis. My responsibilities include integrating AI solutions into current systems, installing and scaling up models for performance and scalability, and presenting findings to stakeholders. I use a variety of ML frameworks and Python to keep up with the most recent developments in the industry and to constantly improve my skills.

**Python Intern @ Techno Spot (_July 2023 - October 2023_)**
- During my internship at Company Name, I gained hands-on experience with Python programming and contributed to several projects. My primary responsibilities included:
     Script Development: Wrote and maintained Python scripts to automate routine tasks, helping improve team efficiency.
     Basic Data Handling: Worked with data files to perform simple data cleaning and basic analysis using Python libraries like Pandas.
- This internship provided a solid foundation in Python development and practical experience in using Python to solve real-world problems.
## Projects
### HikeSmart Toxic Plant Detection And Alert:
- A mobile application developed using Flutter, leveraging AI deep learning with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect poisonous and non-poisonous plants in real-time. The CNN model, trained and optimized using TensorFlow, is converted to a TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) model for seamless integration with the app. The project enhances outdoor safety by providing instant plant identification and will soon include a first-aid guidance module for immediate medical recommendations.
### Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning:
- For this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict heart disease based on patient health metrics. Using a public dataset, I performed data preprocessing and feature engineering to ensure high-quality inputs. I explored several algorithms, including Logistic Regression and Random Forests, and selected the most accurate model based on metrics like accuracy and F1-score. I also fine-tuned the model through hyperparameter optimization and cross-validation. The project concluded with creating visualizations to display predictions and a user interface for risk assessment. This experience enhanced my understanding of machine learning applications in healthcare.
